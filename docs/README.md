# Documentation Map

This directory currently contains a mix of active plans, v2 baseline specs, legacy runtime guides, and historical implementation notes.

## Primary Sources (Current Direction)

- [`ORCHESTRATOR_FIRST_REVAMP_PLAN.md`](ORCHESTRATOR_FIRST_REVAMP_PLAN.md) - Canonical orchestrator-first big-bang revamp blueprint.

## Baseline Specs (Current Code, Pre-Revamp)

- [`UNIFIED_TASK_ORCHESTRATION_SPEC.md`](UNIFIED_TASK_ORCHESTRATION_SPEC.md) - Implemented v2 orchestration contract in the current codebase.

## Legacy Runtime Guides (Pre-v3 Architecture)

- [`archive/legacy/README.md`](archive/legacy/README.md) - Archived runtime usage guides from the pre-v3 architecture.

These remain useful for the existing runtime, but will be rewritten as v3 implementation lands.

## Historical / Point-in-Time Notes

- [`archive/historical/README.md`](archive/historical/README.md) - Archived historical plans, reviews, and earlier roadmap snapshots.

These documents are retained for historical context and should not be treated as current product direction.
