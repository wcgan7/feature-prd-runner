  "issues": [
    {{"severity": "high|medium|low", "text": "Description of the issue"}}
  ]
}}

Review instructions:
- Set "mergeable" to true if the implementation is ready to merge (tests pass, no critical issues).
- Set "mergeable" to false if there are blocking issues that must be fixed before merging.
- List issues with severity "high" for blockers, "medium" for should-fix, "low" for nice-to-have.
- If tests failed (non-zero exit code in coordinator test results), set mergeable=false and include a high severity issue.
- Focus on correctness, spec compliance, and critical code quality issues.
- Keep issue text concise but actionable.
