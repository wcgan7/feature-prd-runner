## High Priority Features

### 🟡 1. Active Human-in-the-Loop Controls

**Status**: 🟡 In Progress (90% Core Complete)
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Impact**: Versatility ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Usefulness ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Robustness ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Implementation Status**:
- ✅ Approval gates system with all gate types
- ✅ Message bus for bidirectional communication
- ✅ CLI commands: steer, approve, reject, view-changes, correct, require
- ✅ Web UI approval gates with visual cards
- ✅ Configuration system with timeouts and context display
- ✅ Desktop notifications for approval gates (optional, via plyer)
- ✅ Live collaboration chat in web UI
- ✅ Real-time messaging between human and worker
- ✅ Inline corrections via CLI (correct, require commands)
- ✅ Breakpoint system (set, list, remove, toggle, clear)
- ✅ Conditional breakpoints with expression evaluation
- ❌ Change review & approval UI (file-by-file)
- ❌ Multi-user collaboration

**Problem**: Current system is too autonomous and hands-off. Hard to steer direction, provide mid-execution guidance, or review/approve changes before they proceed. Once a run starts, you're mostly a passenger until it blocks or completes.

**Solution**:
Comprehensive human-in-the-loop system with approval gates, real-time steering, live feedback, and collaborative controls.

**Key Capabilities**:

**1. Approval Gates**
```yaml
# .prd_runner/config.yaml
approval_gates:
  enabled: true

  gates:
    before_implement:
      enabled: true
      message: "Review implementation plan before proceeding?"
      show_diff: false
      show_plan: true
      timeout: 300  # Auto-approve after 5min

    after_implement:
      enabled: true
      message: "Review code changes before verification?"
      show_diff: true
      allow_edit: true

    before_commit:
      enabled: true
      message: "Review and approve commit?"
      show_diff: true
      show_tests: true
      show_review: true
      required: true  # Cannot skip

    after_review_issues:
      enabled: true
      message: "Review found issues. Continue fixing?"
      show_issues: true
      allow_override: true
```

**2. Interactive Steering During Execution**
```bash
# Real-time control while run is active
feature-prd-runner steer

# Interactive prompt:
# > Run: run-abc123 | Phase: phase-2 | Step: IMPLEMENT
# > Worker is currently: Refactoring auth module...
# >
# > Commands:
# >   [p] Pause execution
# >   [s] Send guidance/steering message
# >   [i] Inject new requirement
# >   [v] View current changes (git diff)
# >   [r] Request explanation of what it's doing
# >   [u] Undo last change
# >   [b] Set breakpoint (pause at next step)
# >   [c] Continue
# >   [q] Quit steering mode
# >
# > Enter command: s
# > Guidance message: Focus on security - ensure input validation
# > Sending to worker... Done!
# > Worker acknowledged: "Adding input validation checks"
```

**3. Live Collaboration Chat**
```python
# src/feature_prd_runner/collaboration.py
class LiveCollaboration:
    """Real-time human-AI collaboration."""

    def send_message(self, message: str, wait_for_response: bool = True):
        """Send message to worker during execution."""
        pass

    def request_clarification(self, question: str) -> str:
        """Ask worker to clarify what it's doing."""
        pass

    def provide_feedback(self, feedback: str, changes: list[str]):
        """Give feedback on specific changes."""
        pass

    def suggest_alternative(self, current_approach: str, alternative: str):
        """Suggest different approach mid-execution."""
        pass

    def request_explanation(self, aspect: str) -> str:
        """Ask worker to explain its reasoning."""
        pass
```

**4. Step-by-Step Approval Mode**
```bash
# Run with step-by-step approval
feature-prd-runner run --prd-file feature.md --interactive

# Or enable for existing run
feature-prd-runner mode --interactive

# Prompts at each step:

# Set breakpoint - pause before specific step
feature-prd-runner breakpoint set --before verify --task phase-1

# Set conditional breakpoint
feature-prd-runner breakpoint set \
  --condition "files_changed > 10" \
  --action pause

# When hit:
# 🔴 BREAKPOINT HIT: phase-1 before VERIFY

        """Add requirement mid-execution."""
        # "Also ensure all endpoints have authentication"
        pass

    def add_constraint(self, constraint: str):
        """Add constraint on implementation."""
        # "Must maintain backwards compatibility"
        pass

    def provide_example(self, example: str, context: str):
        """Show example of what you want."""
        # "Like this: <code example>"
        pass

    def course_correct(self, issue: str, correction: str):
        """Correct course mid-implementation."""
        # "The auth approach is too complex, simplify it"
        pass
```

    slack: false
    sound: true
    request_approval_for:
      - implement
      - commit
      - review_issues
```

**Example Workflows**:

**1. Supervised Implementation**:
```bash
# Start with approvals at each step
feature-prd-runner run --prd-file feature.md \
  --approve-before-implement \
  --approve-before-commit

# At each gate, review and approve/reject
```

**2. Live Steering**:
```bash
# Start run
feature-prd-runner run --prd-file feature.md

# In another terminal, enter steering mode
feature-prd-runner steer

# Send guidance as needed
> "Focus on error handling"
> "Add logging for debugging"
> "Simplify this approach"
```

**3. Collaborative Review**:
```bash
# Dev 1 starts run
feature-prd-runner run --prd-file feature.md --collaborative

# Dev 2 joins to review
feature-prd-runner join run-abc123

# Both can comment, suggest changes, approve
```

**4. Careful Experimentation**:
```bash
# Set breakpoint before risky step
feature-prd-runner breakpoint set --before verify

# Run
feature-prd-runner run --prd-file feature.md

# When breakpoint hits, inspect changes
feature-prd-runner inspect

# If good, continue; if bad, rollback
feature-prd-runner rollback  # or feature-prd-runner continue
```

**Benefits**:
- **Steering Control**: Guide implementation direction in real-time
- **Early Intervention**: Catch issues before they cascade
- **Learning Loop**: Understand AI decision-making through explanations
- **Quality Gates**: Ensure high-quality output through reviews
- **Reduced Rework**: Fix issues immediately rather than after completion
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple people can oversee and guide runs
- **Confidence**: Feel in control rather than being a passive observer
- **Debugging**: Understand why AI made specific choices
- **Course Correction**: Change direction when needed without restarting
- **Incremental Approval**: Approve changes as they happen, not all at once

**Implementation Details**:

**1. Communication Protocol**:
```python
# src/feature_prd_runner/messaging.py
class MessageBus:
    """Bidirectional communication between human and worker."""

    def send_to_worker(self, message: Message):
        """Send message to running worker (via progress.json)."""
        pass

    def receive_from_worker(self) -> list[Message]:
        """Receive messages from worker."""
        pass

    def request_approval(self, approval_request: ApprovalRequest) -> bool:
        """Block and wait for human approval."""
        pass

# Messages go through progress.json:
{
  "run_id": "...",
  "heartbeat": "...",
  "messages_from_human": [
    {
      "id": "msg-123",
      "type": "guidance",
      "content": "Add rate limiting",
      "timestamp": "..."
    }
  ],
  "messages_to_human": [
    {
      "id": "msg-124",
      "type": "clarification_request",
      "content": "Should rate limiting be per-user or per-IP?",
      "timestamp": "..."
    }
  ],
  "approval_pending": {
    "type": "before_implement",
    "data": {...}
  }
}
```

**2. Approval Gate Implementation**:
```python
# src/feature_prd_runner/approval_gates.py
class ApprovalGate:
    """Pause execution and wait for human approval."""

    def request_approval(
        self,
        gate_type: str,
        context: dict,
        timeout: Optional[int] = None
    ) -> ApprovalResponse:
        """
        Block execution and wait for approval.
        Returns: APPROVED, REJECTED, MODIFIED, TIMEOUT
        """
        # Write approval request to state
        # Poll for response or timeout
        # Return result
        pass
```

**3. Web Socket for Real-Time Updates**:
```python
# src/feature_prd_runner/server/websocket.py
@app.websocket("/ws/steer/{run_id}")
async def steer_websocket(websocket: WebSocket, run_id: str):
    """
    Real-time bidirectional communication for steering.

    Client can:
    - Send guidance messages
    - Request explanations
    - Approve/reject changes
    - Set breakpoints

    Server sends:
    - Current status updates
    - Change notifications
    - Approval requests
    - Worker messages
    """
    await websocket.accept()

    while True:
        # Listen for human input
        data = await websocket.receive_json()

        # Process command
        # Send to worker

        # Send updates back
        await websocket.send_json({...})
```

### 🔴 2. Worker Abstraction & Multi-Provider Support

**Status**: 🔴 Not Started
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Impact**: Versatility ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Usefulness ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Robustness ⭐⭐⭐

**Problem**: Hard-coded dependency on Codex CLI limits flexibility and vendor lock-in.

**Solution**:
Create an abstract worker interface to support multiple AI providers.

**Implementation**:
```python
# src/feature_prd_runner/workers/base.py
class WorkerInterface(ABC):
    """Abstract base for AI workers."""

    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self, prompt: str, **kwargs) -> WorkerResult:
        """Execute a prompt and return structured result."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def validate_config(self) -> bool:
        """Verify worker is properly configured."""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def estimate_cost(self, prompt: str) -> float:
        """Estimate cost for executing this prompt."""
        pass

# Concrete implementations
class CodexWorker(WorkerInterface):
    """Existing Codex CLI integration."""
    pass

class OpenAIWorker(WorkerInterface):
    """Direct OpenAI API integration."""
    pass

class AnthropicWorker(WorkerInterface):
    """Claude API integration."""
    pass

class AzureOpenAIWorker(WorkerInterface):
    """Azure OpenAI Service integration."""
    pass

class LocalLLMWorker(WorkerInterface):
    """Local model via Ollama/llama.cpp."""
    pass

class CustomWorker(WorkerInterface):
    """User-defined custom worker."""
    pass
```

**Configuration**:
```yaml
# .prd_runner/config.yaml
workers:
  default: codex

  providers:
    codex:
      type: codex
      command: "codex exec -"

    openai:
      type: openai
      api_key_env: "OPENAI_API_KEY"
      model: "gpt-4-turbo"
      max_tokens: 8000
      temperature: 0.2

    claude:
      type: anthropic
      api_key_env: "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
      model: "claude-3-opus-20240229"

    local:
      type: local
      endpoint: "http://localhost:11434"
      model: "codellama:34b"

  routing:
    # Route different steps to different workers
    plan: codex
    implement: openai
    review: claude

  fallback:
    enabled: true
    order: ["codex", "openai", "claude"]
```

**CLI**:
```bash
# Use specific worker
feature-prd-runner run --prd-file feature.md --worker openai

# List available workers
feature-prd-runner workers list

# Test worker configuration
feature-prd-runner workers test openai

# Compare worker costs
feature-prd-runner workers estimate --prd-file feature.md
```

**Benefits**:
- Support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Azure, local models)
- A/B testing different models for quality/cost optimization
- Fallback to alternative workers on failure
- Cost optimization by routing simple tasks to cheaper models
- Support for local LLMs for sensitive/air-gapped environments
- Future-proof as new models become available

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Abstract `WorkerInterface` defined with all required methods
- [ ] At least 3 concrete worker implementations (Codex, OpenAI, Anthropic)
- [ ] Configuration system supports multiple workers with routing
- [ ] CLI commands for worker management
- [ ] Automatic fallback when primary worker fails
- [ ] Cost estimation API for all workers
- [ ] Tests for each worker implementation
- [ ] Documentation with examples for each provider
- [ ] Migration guide from Codex-only to multi-worker setup

### 🔴 3. Flexible Step Progression & Custom Prompts

**Status**: 🔴 Not Started
**Priority**: P0 (Critical)
**Impact**: Versatility ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Usefulness ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | Robustness ⭐⭐⭐

**Problem**: Current system is rigid - must follow PLAN → IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → REVIEW → COMMIT flow. Hard to inject one-off tasks or custom workflows.

**Solution**:
Support flexible step progression with custom prompts and ad-hoc tasks.

**Implementation**:

**1. Ad-hoc Custom Prompts** (already partially exists via `--custom-prompt`, but enhance it):
```bash
# Run a one-off task without entering normal cycle
feature-prd-runner exec "Update all copyright headers to 2025"

# Run custom prompt and return to normal flow
feature-prd-runner exec "Refactor auth module for clarity" --then continue

# Run custom prompt in specific context
feature-prd-runner exec "Fix mypy errors" --context phase-2 --files "src/**/*.py"

# Chain multiple custom prompts
feature-prd-runner exec "
  1. Update dependencies in requirements.txt
  2. Run tests and fix any failures
  3. Update CHANGELOG.md
" --chain
```

**2. Custom Step Sequences**:
```yaml
# .prd_runner/workflows/hotfix.yaml
name: hotfix
description: Quick hotfix workflow - skip planning and review
steps:
  - implement
  - verify
  - commit  # Skip review for hotfixes

# .prd_runner/workflows/thorough.yaml
name: thorough
description: Extra thorough review process
steps:
  - plan_impl
  - implement
  - verify
  - review
  - security_scan  # Custom step
  - manual_approval  # Custom step
  - commit

# .prd_runner/workflows/experimental.yaml
name: experimental
description: Experimental feature with checkpoints
steps:
  - plan_impl
  - checkpoint
  - implement
  - checkpoint
  - verify
  - rollback_if_failed  # Custom step
```

**3. Step Injection**:
```bash
# Inject a step before current step
feature-prd-runner inject --before verify "Run benchmark tests"

# Inject after current step
feature-prd-runner inject --after implement "Generate documentation"

# Replace current step
feature-prd-runner inject --replace review "Quick sanity check"
```

**4. Conditional Steps**:
```yaml
# .prd_runner/config.yaml
workflows:
  default:
    steps:
      - plan_impl
      - implement
      - verify
      - review:
          condition: "changed_lines > 100 or files_include('auth/**')"
      - security_scan:
          condition: "files_include('**/*.env') or phase_id == 'security-hardening'"
      - commit
```

**5. Step Hooks**:
```python
# src/feature_prd_runner/hooks.py
class StepHooks:
    """Define hooks for custom logic at each step."""

    @hook('before_implement')
    def backup_current_state(self, phase: dict):
        """Create backup before implementation."""
        pass

    @hook('after_verify')
    def update_coverage_report(self, phase: dict, result: VerifyResult):
        """Update coverage dashboard."""
        pass

    @hook('before_commit')
    def require_ticket_number(self, changes: dict) -> bool:
        """Enforce ticket number in commit message."""
        pass
```

**6. Interactive Mode**:
```bash
# Interactive step-by-step execution
feature-prd-runner interactive --prd-file feature.md

# Prompts:
# > Current step: IMPLEMENT (phase-1)
# > Options:
# >   [c] Continue with step
# >   [s] Skip this step
# >   [r] Retry this step
# >   [e] Execute custom prompt
# >   [j] Jump to different step
# >   [p] Pause and save state
# >   [q] Quit
# > Choice: e
# > Custom prompt: Add debug logging to auth module
# > Executing... Done!
# > Continue with IMPLEMENT? [y/n]: y
```

**7. Parallel Custom Tasks**:
```bash
# Run multiple custom tasks in parallel
feature-prd-runner exec-parallel \
  "Update API documentation" \
  "Regenerate OpenAPI spec" \
  "Run performance benchmarks"
```

**Configuration**:
```yaml
# .prd_runner/config.yaml
workflows:
  enabled: true
  default_workflow: standard

  available:
    - standard  # PLAN → IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → REVIEW → COMMIT
    - hotfix    # IMPLEMENT → VERIFY → COMMIT
    - thorough  # Includes security scans and manual approval
    - experimental  # With checkpoints and rollback

step_hooks:
  enabled: true
  scripts:
    before_implement: "scripts/backup.sh"
    after_verify: "scripts/update_coverage.sh"
    before_commit: "scripts/check_ticket.py"

custom_steps:
  security_scan:
    command: "npm audit"
    timeout: 300

  manual_approval:
    type: interactive
    prompt: "Review changes and approve to continue"
```

**API for Custom Steps**:
```python
# src/feature_prd_runner/custom_steps.py
from feature_prd_runner.steps import CustomStep

class SecurityScanStep(CustomStep):
    """Custom security scanning step."""

    def execute(self, context: StepContext) -> StepResult:
        # Run security scan
        result = subprocess.run(["npm", "audit"], ...)

        if result.returncode != 0:
            return StepResult.failed("Security vulnerabilities found")

        return StepResult.success()

    def should_run(self, context: StepContext) -> bool:
        # Only run for certain phases
        return context.phase_id.startswith("security-")

# Register custom step
register_step("security_scan", SecurityScanStep())
```

**Benefits**:
- One-off tasks without disrupting workflow
- Custom workflows for different scenarios (hotfix, experimental, thorough)
- Step hooks for automation
- Interactive control during execution
- Conditional step execution
- Parallel custom task execution
- Extensible with custom step types

class ErrorAnalyzer:
    """Analyze and explain errors."""

    def analyze_error(
        self,
        task_id: str,

        """Human-readable blocking explanation."""
        pass

class DebugSession:
    """Interactive debugging session."""

    def replay_task(
        self,

```

**Enhanced Error Messages**:
```python
# Instead of:
# "Verification failed"

# Provide:
"""
❌ Verification Failed: phase-1 (attempt 3/10)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Failed Command:
  pytest -v tests/

Exit Code: 1
Duration: 3.2s

Failed Tests (2):
  📍 tests/test_auth.py::test_login [line 45]
     AssertionError: assert 401 == 200

  📍 tests/test_auth.py::test_logout [line 78]
     AttributeError: 'User' has no attribute 'session'

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Root Cause Analysis:
  The User model is missing the 'session' field required by
  logout logic. Login test also failing due to incorrect
  status code expectation.

Files Involved:
  • src/models/user.py (missing 'session' field)
  • tests/test_auth.py (2 failing tests)
  • src/auth/logout.py (references user.session)

Suggested Actions:
  1. Add 'session' field to User model
     → File: src/models/user.py:23
     → Add: session: Optional[Session] = None

  2. Update test expectation
     → File: tests/test_auth.py:45
     → Change: assert response.status == 200

  3. Update test fixtures to include session data
     → File: tests/fixtures.py
     → Add session data to user_factory

Quick Fixes:
  [1] Retry verification
      feature-prd-runner retry phase-1

  [2] Skip verification (not recommended)
      feature-prd-runner skip-step phase-1 --step verify

  [3] Debug interactively
      feature-prd-runner debug phase-1

  [4] View full logs
      feature-prd-runner logs phase-1 --step verify

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Next Steps:
  The runner will automatically retry this step.
  If it fails again, the task will be blocked for review.

  Attempts remaining: 7/10
"""
```

**CLI Commands**:
```bash
# Debug a task
feature-prd-runner debug phase-1
# Interactive mode with state inspection

# Replay task with verbose logging
feature-prd-runner replay phase-1 --step implement --verbose

# Explain why blocked
